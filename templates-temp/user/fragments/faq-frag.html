    {% set qas = [ { "question": "How quickly can I get my chatbot up and
    running?", "answer": "Your chatbot can be ready in 5 to 15 business days. We
    take care of everything from setup to integration, so you can focus on
    seeing results." }, { "question": "Do I need to be tech-savvy to manage the
    chatbot?", "answer": "No technical knowledge is required. We handle all the
    management, updates, and optimizations. You can easily make updates through
    our user-friendly dashboard or let us know what changes you'd like." }, {
    "question": "Can customers tell they're interacting with a bot?", "answer":
    "You decide! The chatbot can be clearly identified as a bot or designed to
    feel like a natural part of the conversation. Either way, your customers
    will enjoy quick and convenient interactions." }, { "question": "Does the
    chatbot support multiple languages?", "answer": "Yes, our chatbots can
    interact in various languages, including English and Arabic, using natural
    and localized phrasing." }, { "question": "What happens if a customer needs
    to speak with a human?", "answer": "The chatbot can smoothly transfer the
    conversation to a live agent, create a support ticket, or arrange a
    callback, ensuring a seamless experience." }, { "question": "Is the chatbot
    compatible with our current tools like CRM or WhatsApp?", "answer":
    "Absolutely! Our chatbots integrate with major platforms like WhatsApp,
    Messenger, Shopify, HubSpot, and more. We can also connect via API if
    needed." }, { "question": "How secure is the chatbot?", "answer": "Security
    is a top priority. We comply with GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO standards, and you
    have full control over access levels, data privacy, and retention policies."
    }, { "question": "Can the chatbot access our internal files and folders?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can securely access both local and cloud-based files with
    appropriate security filters." }, { "question": "What AI models are
    available for use?", "answer": "You can choose from several AI models like
    GPT, Gemini, Claude, or Deepseek, depending on your plan." }, { "question":
    "What if the chatbot doesn't know an answer?", "answer": "If the chatbot is
    unsure, it will either escalate the query to a more advanced AI model or
    transfer it to a human agent, based on your settings." }, { "question": "Is
    there a dashboard for tracking performance?", "answer": "Yes, we provide a
    dashboard with insights into chat history, usage statistics, and performance
    metrics, tailored to your plan." }, { "question": "How long does the initial
    setup take?", "answer": "The setup typically takes between 5 to 10 working
    days, depending on the complexity and the extent of integration required."
