    knowledge is required. We handle all the management, updates, and

    { "topic": "Chatbot - Features & Customization", "questions": [ {
    "question": "Can customers tell they're interacting with a bot?", "answer":

    will enjoy quick and convenient interactions." }, { "question": "Does the
    chatbot support multiple languages?", "answer": "Yes, our chatbots can
    interact in various languages, including English and Arabic, using natural
    and localized phrasing." }, { "question": "Can the chatbot access our

    local and cloud-based files with appropriate security filters." }, {
    "question": "What AI models are available for use?", "answer": "You can

    Support & Escalation", "questions": [ { "question": "What happens if a

    transfer the conversation to a live agent, create a support ticket, or
    arrange a callback, ensuring a seamless experience." }, { "question": "What
    if the chatbot doesn't know an answer?", "answer": "If the chatbot is
    unsure, it will either escalate the query to a more advanced AI model or
    transfer it to a human agent, based on your settings." } ] }, { "topic":
    "Chatbot - Security & Performance", "questions": [ { "question": "How secure
    is the chatbot?", "answer": "Security is a top priority. We comply with

    fee applies for Starter plans. It covers the work of preparing your website,
    connecting hosting, SSL, and making it ready to launch." }, { "question":
    "Why do I need to pay 3 months upfront?", "answer": "Because it ensures your
    website is built and launched properly. After the first 3 months, you can
    continue month by month." }, { "question": "Can I cancel anytime? What
    happens after I cancel?", "answer": "Yes, you can cancel after 3 months.
    Your website will remain online until the end of the paid period, after
    which it will be turned off. Any remaining days are non-refundable to reduce
    administrative hassle." } ] }, { "topic": "Features & Flexibility",
    "questions": [ { "question": "Can I change the design, colors, and logo?",
    "answer": "Yes — all templates are just samples. We replace everything with
    your brand colors, logo, and style." }, { "question": "Are these templates
    limited to certain industries?", "answer": "No — they can be used for any
    business: shops, services, restaurants, schools, or companies." }, {

    "Your plan includes a set amount. If you need more, you can buy extra hours
    anytime." }, { "question": "Do you offer content writing or stock images?",

    professional stock photos. Extra search or revisions, an hourly small
    charge." } ] }, { "topic": "Technical & Support", "questions": [ {
    "question": "Is hosting really included? What about SSL?", "answer": "Yes,
    hosting and SSL are always included in the monthly fee. No extra cost. Our
    plans include enough space for normal websites (usually up to 5–10GB). If
    you need more, we offer a low-cost hosting upgrade add-on." }, { "question":
    "Do you provide email accounts too?", "answer": "We can help connect email
    services if needed, but emails are not included in the base package; still,
    you can get them separately. Another option is to help you connect to Google
    Workspace or Microsoft 365. This way, your email is reliable and separate
    from your website." }, { "question": "What kind of support is included in
    the subscription?", "answer": "We handle updates, backups, security, and
    small changes. You can always contact us for help." }, { "question": "How

    add-on." }, { "question": "Do you offer marketing support or just
    websites?", "answer": "Yes, we also offer SEO, social media setup, and
